# BitSee
### _Version 0.1.1_
Check the bitcoin balance and history for any Bitcoin Wallet address.

Either build your own by cloning to a folder and running:
```
python3 setup.py py2app
```

Or, just download the [latest version](https://github.com/jamesacampbell/BitBalance/finalversion.zip).

Example of how it works. You simply paste in the wallet and it shows all transactions, hash, ip address, and date of transaction as well as the current balance of the wallet.
